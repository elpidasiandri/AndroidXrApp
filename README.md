## TechAndroidXrApp

> AndroidXrApp is an experimental Android application developed as part of a study exploring the integration of computer vision techniques within Extended Reality (XR) environments. The application serves as an interactive educational tool, demonstrating the Android Activity Lifecycle through immersive XR presentations.

**Features**
- Interactive XR Presentation: Visualizes the Android Activity Lifecycle stages with corresponding slides.
- Audio Narration: Each slide is accompanied by a brief audio explanation to enhance understanding.
- Spatial Panel Integration: Utilizes a virtual interface panel within the 3D environment to present content.
- Orbiter Element: Implements a dynamic visual element that orbits the panel, providing visual cues during transitions.
- ARCore APIs: Leverages ARCore for spatial tracking, environmental understanding, and light estimation to ensure realistic interaction between virtual objects and the physical environment.

**Technologies Used**
- Android Studio (Canary version): For development and leveraging the experimental Android XR Emulator.
- ARCore: Provides the foundational XR capabilities, including motion tracking and environmental understanding.
- Jetpack Compose for XR: Facilitates the creation of dynamic and engaging user interfaces tailored for immersive environments.
- Spatial Panel & Orbiter - Custom components designed to enhance user interaction within the XR space

**Usage**
- Upon launching the application:
- Navigate through the XR presentation to explore different stages of the Android Activity Lifecycle.
- Each slide provides visual and auditory information to facilitate learning.
